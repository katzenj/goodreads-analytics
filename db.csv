**spoiler alert** There's a lot of good -- the need for play, recognizing the impact diet/environment has, the importance of sleep/rest, etc. But some of the claims about systematic changes and even a mention of state-owned social media felt a bit over the-top. I think people should take a bit more ownership over their own actions but do recognize that the deck is stacked against us with all of the features designed to keep us hooked.Still worth a read as a reminder of what we do have control over and how we can affect change.

I avoided this book for a while because it seemed cliche, and I figured I already knew what I was doing (spoiler: I didn't). It was honestly much better than I expected. Would give 4.5 if GoodReads would let me :) One of the biggest learnings I had was how making habits simple entry points (e.g. putting on your gym shoes or putting a book on the pillow) sets us up for success and makes our broader goals (like working out) more attainable. It's not necessarily a new finding for some, but it is a good reminder of how breaking things down into easily digestible pieces sets you up for success much better than the alternative.James Clear did such a fantastic job of synthesizing the relevant information, providing real-world examples, and doling out valuable insights into how we can both build and break habits.

I expected more storytelling with tidbits of research, but it was a lot of research with a one main background story, the sub 2hr marathon attempt, and other smaller stories of human endurance dotted throughout. Though not what I expected, I finished with a bunch of research that I’ve noted to see how it can help me in my future ~athletic~ endeavors. It was refreshing to read specific research and citations on the impacts of high fat, low carb diets, working out in fasted vs. depleted states, etc. rather than just reading yet another article with vaguely cited stats about why “Keto is best.”

10/10 recommend. I loved it so much I bought it after picking returning it to the library.Removing ~some~ (really not that much) comfort from our lives can positively impact us for the better. Simple actions like ignoring reward hunger food cravings, turning down the AC a few degrees, or allowing yourself to sit in boredom can improve your mental and physical well-being.Even though the only personal limit I have pushed is how many pieces of sushi I can eat at dinner, I love reading about how I can push myself to be better. If you have any interest in mental or physical well-being, pick up this book. If you want to be more conscious about the impacts of our cushy modern life, pick up this book.My key takeaways: it’s good to be bored, the body uses small stressors to be resilient, craft my own misogi, make it novel each time, and push my limits -- but do not die.
